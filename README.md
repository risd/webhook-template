# This is a webhook template for the RISD Media Group

The template includes Bourbon, Neat, jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Sticky, Packery, and PictureFill. More modules to come.

## How to create a webhook site
**If a repo doens't exist**  
Start by creating a repo on GitHub under the *Media Account*  
*Do not* create a README file when prompted by Github  


**If a webhook instance *isn't* initiated in the repo**  
`cd` to the folder where you store your websites and  
```
wh create risd-repo-name
```  
*Use the mgdevelopers@risd.edu account credentials*  


**Serve the webhook site**  
`cd` to the folder the `wh create` made for you, and  
```
wh serve
```  


## How to use the template in the site

When you create a new webhook site, the first time you open the CMS, it will ask you if you want to start from scratch, or use a template.  
Use the .zip file of this repo as the template.  
Once the file is imported,  
```
wh deploy
```
This will allow you to see the changes in the CMS.


## Add yourself and others as team members

You are currently logged in as *mgdevelopers@risd.edu*, and there are no other members added.  
Under the *Team Members* tab, add yourself, and any other members to the site.  
Log out, and log back in as yourself.


## Initiate git in the folder

`cd` to the site folder if you aren't already in it  
```
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/risd/repo-name.git
git push -u origin master
```





Due to certain restrictions of the process, or the lack of knowledge of the process, there is one extra step that needs to be done after importing the template into your site:  
In `pages/cms.html`,  
after the line
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cms.webhook.com/{{ cmsVersion }}/assets/app.min.css">
```  
add the line
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/cms-custom.css"/>
```


## How to set up Git Flow for the site

**To initialize git flow:**  
make sure you've commited and pushed, then  
```
git flow init
```

**To create a new feature branch:**  
make sure you're on develop  
```
git flow feature start featureName
git push --set-upstream origin feature/featureName
```

**To make commits**  
check what files you need to commit  
```
git status
```

add and commit the files  
```
git add -A
git status
git commit -m "summary

description"
git push
git status
```

**To finish feature**  
make sure you, and everyone else working on the branch has committed, and that all the conflicts are resolved  
```
git flow feature finish featureName
```

To access someone else's feature branch  
```
git pull
git fetch
git branch -a
```

This should give you a list of local branches in black, current branch in green and remote branches in red.
The feature branch you're looking for is most probably red.  
```
git checkout feature/featureName
```  
This should make the remote feature branch a local branch.

**If you can't see the branch anywhere for some reason, try**  
```
git ls-remote origin
git fetch
```

**If a finished featured branch is still showing up when you do `git branch -a`, try**  
```
git push origin :feature/featureName
git remote prune origin
```
